    <p> I'm a random weirdo on the internet who spends entirely too much time on the internet. You'll see me dabbling in all sorts of mad things which I have no buisness dabbling in. Most of my experiences are mostly caused by me asking questions. I love learning and spend most of my time learning because it is nice to apply new skills. My education career in adulthood is extended due to repeated health issues. My health has always been a particular struggle for me. I always try my best to complete things as they are explained to me as throughly as I can. If details are left out or if they are not repeated to me enough I will forget them. Overall I try my best and do the best that I can do. I enjoy helping others and frankly don't give a damn about how that reflects on myself. Which is why it is one of my greater vices as due to my insistence on helping others I forget to ask for help for myself. I need to ask for help more often, but it helps if you see me struggling at any stage to ask me if I am doing okay once in a while or to tell me that I'm doing good when I am doing good. This is how I best learn.</p>
