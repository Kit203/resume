# About-Me
This is a Git for my resume website; which is part 1 of my self-taught coding series. 
This Git will be connected with a resume where my host of skill sets will be put out for display. 
This website will feature the following: Sewing, Code [languages I dabble in], 3D Modelling [tutorials I dabbled with], Maps [GIS/QGIS, no dabbling here], or AgiSoft models [nor dabbling here]. 
This website will also showcase my past work history and education history. 
This website will also translate it to any relevant languages which I am semi-profient in. [French/Spanish/(Japanese/Italian)]
Yes, I know I'm awesome. Thanks for noticing.
